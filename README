This terraform codebase spun up the entire infrastructure for a Search as a Service product that I founded. The entire pipeline code was written by me using Terraform at that point of time. 
I am hundred percent sure this code is quite useless from a syntax standpoint. It might still be a good reference point for a small infrastructure.
Use it at your peril. Note that this was done with speed of development as the primary motivation and it wasn't refactored / improved upon. 

28/Apr/2021:
Uploading the code to github for posterity and in read-only mode. 

04/Nov/2017:
Featurs to be supported:

Types of Clusters / Nodes
- Access Node (ssh)
  - ports: 22
- Jenkins for Code Deploy (Jenkins)
- PStack Main Website (nginx, node js apps)
- Customer Authentication (Redis, MysQL)
- RSearch Web Service (Django RSearch App, ES)
- Customer Analytics (Kafka, ES, Logstash)

Remaining work depending on future stuff:

- Implementing Auto-scaling across everything
- Implementing proper Routing:
  - Specifically NAT, etc
